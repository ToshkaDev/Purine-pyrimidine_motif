# Purine-pyrimidine_motif

Data accompanying the paper on purine binding receptors 

We defined the purine motif as follows:

[YF] x (~7-8) [RKH] x (~6-10) [WF][YF] x (~21-28) [YF] x [DN]

Multiple sequence alignments built using NCBI RefSeq sequences corresponding to the purine binding receptors are in the **Alignment** folder. The positions corresponding to the purine motif in the _purine_receptors_aln_linsi_ed.fa_ file are as follows:


[YF] (**113**) x (~7-8) [RKH] (**126**) x (~6-10) [WF][YF] (**140**) x (~21-28) [YF] (**175**) x [DN] (**177**)

The bayesian phylogenetic tree and the multiple sequence alignment used are in the **Phylogeny** folder.

Detailed information about dCache_1PU containing proteins, purine motif variants, and taxonomy and isolation sources of the corresponding organisms can be found in the **Metadata** folder.
